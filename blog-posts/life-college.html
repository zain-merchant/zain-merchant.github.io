              <p>College has been the most transformative chapter of my life. While I learned a little from the classes, it was the people around me that truly made this time impactful. Over the past four years, I've kept a running note on my phone, adding to it every time someone said something that made me think. Here is an excerpt from that list.</p>
              
              
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Comfort stunts growth. To solve this, actively seek out new experiences, and be open to opportunities when they come. Being comfortable isn‚Äôt necessarily bad ‚Äî but it can trap you on a local maximum in the curve of having a great life.</li>
                <li>Be curious. Ask questions and be genuinely interested in people. Everyone has something worth learning.</li>
                <li>Call people. It‚Äôs too easy to lose touch. When you find people worth having in your life, make the effort to keep them in it.</li>
                <li>Health is number one. Treat your body and mind as a non-negotiable first priority.</li>
                <li>Surround yourself with great people. This might be the highest leverage thing you can do.</li>
                <li>Ask for people‚Äôs names and remember them.</li>
                <li>Initiate. Sometimes, all it takes is for you to go first.</li>
                <li>Enjoy the fruits and the labor. </li>
                <li>Work expands to fill the time you give it.</li>
                <li>Limit test. Challenge yourself and figure out what you‚Äôre capable of. You‚Äôre probably underestimating yourself.</li>
                <li>Happiness is a choice, so choose it.</li>
                <li>Putting people on a pedestal is normal, but don‚Äôt try too hard to be someone else. The reason you admire them is because they‚Äôre not trying to be anyone but themselves.</li>
                <li>Be universally kind.</li>
                <li>Be politely relentless.</li>
                <li>Burnout is often a lack of meaning or progress. You can grind forever if the work matters to you. If it doesn‚Äôt, even an hour is too much.</li>
                <li>Don‚Äôt waste time.</li>
                <li>You can just do things. After school, no one‚Äôs assigning life anymore. A good exercise is to ask: if I had 10x the agency as I do now, what would I be doing?</li>
                <li>Building a great career is a subset of the true problem in life, having a good life.</li>
                <li>Learn how to fight well. Have hard conversations without arrogance and with a growth mindset.</li>
                <li>There is almost always a third door. The scrappy and unconventional way to get what you want.</li>
                <li>‚ÄúYouth is wasted on the young‚Äù. Live beneath your means, but don‚Äôt be afraid to spend on things you‚Äôll remember forever.</li>
                <li>Ask yourself whether you're doing something for ego or for soul.</li>
              </ol>
